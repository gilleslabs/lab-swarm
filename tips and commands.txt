Delete a stack

Before redeploying a stack check network are deleted:
docker network ls

Then wait - redeploying just after deletion may fail

if necessary, delete network:
docker network rm [stack_name]_[network_name]

Sometime deletion of volume might be needed:
docker volume ls
docker network rm [stack_name]_[volume_name] 
and also on /convoy-nfs:
sudo rm -Rf [stack_name]_[volume_name]
